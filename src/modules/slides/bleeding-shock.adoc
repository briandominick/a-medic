= Bleeding & Shock
// tag::slide-1[]
[IMPORTANT.red]
Severe bleeding is always a red flag, no matter when it's discovered.

Signs of severe bleeding::

* evidence or suspicion of massive blood loss
** more than a pint in an adult at any rate
* arterial bleeding
** bright red
** spurting
* shock

// tag::slide-2[]
Bleeding control::

. Apply direct pressure to the site of the wound, as long as doing so will not cause further injury.
. If direct pressure does not control severe bleeding or cannot be applied, consider a tourniquet.

// end::slide-2[]

Direct pressure::

. Take body substance isolation precautions!
. Apply direct pressure with a gloved hand until gauze is available.
. Bleeding should stop within 3-5 minutes.

[WARNING.mini]
Removing gauze risks breaking any clot that is forming.
Keep packing it on as blood soaks through.

[TIP.mini]
Patients can apply direct pressure to their own wound in many cases, which can be empowering.
Exercise good judgment.

Indications for tourniquet::

* Amputation above the wrist or ankle.
* Severe bleeding not stopped by direct pressure.
* Direct pressure cannot be applied to site of wound.

[TIP.mini]

Hypovolemic shock::

Caused by internal or external blood loss -- technically, a severe loss of _blood volume_.
