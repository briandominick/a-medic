= Practical: Curbside Eye Treatment
// tag::slide-1[]
Challenge::
Pair up with a partner and practice administering and receiving an eye flush.

Patients::
* Simulate a real incident by resisting the opening of your eye as best you can.
* Don't let the medic get away with missing steps, including *consent* and *contacts* checks.
* If you're “not sure”, their flush was _insufficient_.

Medics::
* Remember to sweep inside to outside corners of eye.
* Perform flushes until the patient confirms you've gotten water in their eye with a forceful flush.
