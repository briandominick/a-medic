How we get consent::

* Approach calmly and cautiously.
* Introduce yourself confidently and swiftly, e.g.

What's a street medic to do?::

* Be persistent but not pushy.
* Validate and address the patient's concerns, e.g.
** “I can understand how this might be scary.”
** “Would you prefer if my partner takes care of you and I mostly keep watch?”
** Establish privacy barriers.
* Innovate!
* Always take “No” for an answer.
