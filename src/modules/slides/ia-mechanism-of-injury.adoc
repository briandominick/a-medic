= Mechanism of Injury
// tag::slide-1[]
MOI::
  The _immediate_ cause of an injury or sudden illness.

* Do _not_ think like a radical at this stage!
* It's not the _root_ cause, but the _direct_ cause.

// end::slide-1[]

// tag::slide-2[]
MOI determines::

* Whether the danger persists
** potential harm to you, e.g.
*** cops
*** traffic
** continuing to harm the patient, e.g.
*** burns
*** ongoing brutality
*** vehicle

Cervical spinal injuries::

[WARNING.mini]
Injuries to the vertebrae in the neck can cause paralysis, including fatal paralysis.

Positive MOI for C-spine injury::

* fall from twice one's height
* severe motor vehicle accident
* motor vehicle to pedestrian
* direct trauma to the neck

[IMPORTANT.mini]
If you suspect a C-spine injury, you must immediately initiate C-spine stabilization.

// tag::slide-5[]
Intervention: C-spine stabilization::

*Principal:* Prevent further injury to the cervical vertebrae and spinal cord by restricting movement.

* Approach from the front
* Tell the injured person to keep their head still.

[TIP.mini]
More important than keeping the patient still is keeping the neck stable and in line.

Intervention: C-spine Stabilization::

* Gently bring the neck into alignment.
** STOP! if:
*** the patient feels pain
*** there is grinding (“crepitus”)
* Firmly hold both sides of the patient's head.
* Someone must hold this position until advanced help arrives.

Persistent MOI::

--
The other potential red flag for the MOI stage is a _persistent mechanism of injury_.

. What is the MOI for a burn?
[%step]
** _Heat_ -- so that's what we try to address.
[%step]
. How about MOI for an impaled object?
[%step]
** The _object_ -- we don't remove these, so we're going need further care.

[IMPORTANT.mini]
Persistent MOI calls for intervention. If you cannot intervene safely or successfully, get help!
