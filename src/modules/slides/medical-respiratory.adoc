// tag::slide-1[]
We know _respiratory distress_ is a red flag during initial assessment, but activating 9-1-1 does not have to be our only intervention.

[IMPORTANT.red.mini]
Respiratory excitement from physical exertion does not typically turn life threatening.
Distressed breathing should improve with rest, or else icon:flag[role=red].

Respiratory distress defined::

Breathing that is inadequate to sustain proper perfusion of vital organs.

* too shallow / rapid (more than 25 breaths per minute)
* too infrequent (fewer than 8 breaths per minute)
* too strained (asthma, anaphylaxis, COPD, injury)
* too inconsistent (agonal, apneic)

Causes of respiratory distress at actions::

* injury to airway or chest
* asthma
* shock (mental or physical)
// end::slide-2[]

// tag::slide-3[]
General interventions for respiratory distress::

* Seat the patient upright, leaning forward, elbows on knees (“tripod”).
* Breathe along with the patient, exhibiting calm and confidence.
// end::slide-3[]

// tag::slide-4[]
Airway/chest injuries::

* Treat as directed in *Special Injuries*, then apply general treatment for respiratory distress.

* Remember, most basic interventions for airway trauma will decompensate quickly.

* Rapid intubation, chest decompression, and drainage saves lives.

* Tripod position may not be appropriate, depending on injury.

Asthma overview::
Asthma attacks are spasms/constrictions of the bronchioles.

Signs/symptoms of asthma attack::

* person suffers from asthma
* severe wheezing (both in and out)
* mucous production
* non-stop coughing
* rapid / shallow breathing
* chest tightness / pressure
* tightened neck / chest muscles (called retractions)
* difficulty talking
* sense of anxiety / panic

Asthma intervention::

. Help them use their inhaler.
. If distress continues/worsens, activate 9-1-1. icon:flag[role=red]
. Treat with general intervention.

[IMPORTANT.black.mini]
Do not use someone else's inhaler unless the patient can affirmatively identify it as the same prescription.

Anaphylactic shock overview::
Allergic reaction including severe swelling that constricts the upper airway.

Signs/symptoms of anaphylactic shock::

* person suffers from anaphylaxis / knows source of reaction
* skin reactions (hives / itching / paleness)
* swollen lips, tongue, or throat
* tightness in the throat / sense of airways closing
* hoarseness / trouble speaking
* nausea, abdominal pain, or vomiting
* rapid pulse / low blood pressure
* dizziness / loss of consciousness

// tag::slide-8[]
Anaphylactic shock intervention::

. Help them administer epinephrine using epipen.
. Activate 9-1-1. icon:flag[role=red]
. Treat with general intervention.

[IMPORTANT.mini.black]
Do not administer epinephrine for hemorrhagic shock or for any purpose other than anaphylactic shock.
