= Musculoskeletal Injuries
// tag::slide-1[]
Injuries to bones, muscles, and the stuff holding it all together, most especially:

* breaks (bone fractures)
* sprains (injury to the ligaments between bones)
* strains (injury to muscles and/or tendons)
* dislocations (dislodgment of long bone from joint)

Differentiating between breaks and sprains::

Except in cases of obvious factures (deformity/exposed bone), don't bother diagnosing -- we treat them all the same.

[TIP]
Only an X-ray can rule out fracture, and it's never worth risking.
Always refer what you think are sprains for immediate follow-up care.

Treatment is the same for all::

. Examine the site.
. Check pulses/perfusion (compare to opposite side).
. Treat any wounds at the site.
. Treat with RICE.

* RICE treats pain, prevents exacerbation, and restricts swelling.

* *Rest* includes immobilization and protection of the injury site.

* *Ice* = 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off.

Principles for immobilizing musculoskeletal injuries::

* For long bones, immobilize at least the joints “above and below” the injured bone.

* For joints, immobilize the long bones connected to the joint.

* Protect the injury site.

* Check perfusion before wrapping/splinting.

Dislocations in the field::

[IMPORTANT.black.mini]
If you have not been specifically trained to treat a specific type of dislocation, do not attempt to relocate a dislocated bone.

* Treat with *RICE* and refer to ED or urgent care.
